# PhoenixRoles
## An example Phoenix user management and roles application

This is a project by [DailyDrip](https://www.dailydrip.com) to show off a basic
phoenix application using [`coherence`](https://github.com/smpallen99/coherence)
for user management, and using
[`policy_wonk`](https://github.com/boydm/policy_wonk) for authorization.

## Development

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check the Phoenix deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
